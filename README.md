# MaiKS

MaiKS is a microkernel-inspired governance layer that runs inside your project workspace. It applies rules, a pre-write security check, and persistent memory to AI coding agents (Claude Code, Antigravity/Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf) working in your codebase.

> **Deterministic, Git-Native Memory**
> Instead of a vector database (RAG), MaiKS stores memory as plain Markdown and JSON files alongside your code, organized as a Hub (global project knowledge) and Spokes (per-branch task notes). When someone clones the repo, their AI reads the same project knowledge, decision history, and custom skills — no external database required.

## Key Features

*   **Microkernel Structure**: Separation between kernel space (rules, configuration) and user space (skills, memory, commands).
*   **PDCA Self-Evolution**: A Plan-Do-Check-Act lifecycle. If the AI finds a more efficient pattern, it can propose and apply upgrades to its own workflows and skills, with rollback if integrity checks fail.
*   **Flexible Agent Delegation**: The primary agent acts as a coordinator that can edit code directly, or delegate complex, multi-file work to specialized subagents if the host environment supports it.
*   **Pre-Mutation Security Checklist**: A security review runs before any code is written to disk, checking for hardcoded credentials, injection patterns, and unsafe functions. This isn't a substitute for a dedicated SAST tool (Semgrep, Snyk, etc.) in CI.
*   **Self-Healing**: Loop detection breaks out of repeated-failure cycles. When the AI fixes a non-trivial issue, it prompts you to extract the fix into a permanent playbook so the same error doesn't need re-diagnosing next time.
*   **Perception & Stack Discovery**: Can profile your workspace (via `OS_COMMAND INFRA_DISCOVER_MODULES`) to detect tech stack drift, map sub-modules, and generate new semantic rules or custom skills based on what it finds.
*   **Idea-to-Code Scaffolding**: An `Architect` skill that walks greenfield ideas through a structured interview to a project plan, code scaffolding, and environment config.
*   **IDE Bridge Files**: Hooks into your IDE's customization system (`.agents/skills.json`, a root `AGENTS.md`, plus host-specific files like `CLAUDE.md` and Cursor's `.mdc` rules) so skills and memory are loaded into the agent's context — each bridge file carries a self-sufficient minimum contract even on hosts that never run the full boot sequence.
*   **Four-Tier Memory Model**: Reduces cross-session context loss by maintaining Episodic (decisions), Semantic (project structure), Task (active branch), and Procedural (executable playbooks) memory.
*   **Hub and Spoke Task Memory**: When you switch to a feature or bugfix branch, working memory is isolated into a dedicated task file, keeping the global project knowledge file free of branch-specific noise.
*   **Verified Memory Promotion**: Task notes are deliberately unscrutinized working memory — half-formed ideas and dead ends are expected. Before anything gets promoted into permanent, cross-session semantic memory, it's checked two ways: is the claim still factually true against the current code, *and* was the underlying change actually accepted (not still buggy, mid-revision, or awaiting your sign-off)? A description of a bug that's still in the code is a true statement and a bad thing to remember as "how it works."

## Token Economics

**"Won't reading the entire framework on every boot cost a fortune in tokens?"**

It would — so the OS doesn't do that. `BOOT.md` is a small hot core (~4,000 tokens as measured) that carries a condensed rules digest and *pointers* to the full rules, skill procedures, and command catalog, rather than inlining them. Boot reads six small files — `BOOT.md`, `manifest.json`, `project_genome.json`, your active archetype file, a single-entry session-continuity summary, and the currently-open task memory file (`memory/tasks/*.md` — `BOOT.md` §2 step 4 requires one every session, including on `main`) — and stops there. The full text of `rules/*.md`, `registry/*/SKILL.md`, and `commands/index.json` (tens of KB combined) loads only when a specific situation actually calls for it: a rule conflict, a security-sensitive change, or a command being invoked.

Net effect: boot costs roughly **4,500–5,000 tokens** (the task file's size is the one variable component) regardless of how much governance content the framework has accumulated, since new rules and skills live in files that are opt-in by trigger, not opt-out by size. Provider-side context caching (Claude, Gemini, GPT-4o, etc.) still helps on top of this for the parts that are read repeatedly, but it's a bonus, not the mechanism the design relies on.

## Installation & Upgrade Guide

### Package Layout (Before Install)
The downloaded/cloned package lives anywhere on your machine — not inside your project.
```
maiks/
├── .ai-os/                          # The OS Kernel
├── .ai-os-installer/                # The Agentic Installer
│   ├── INSTALL_PROMPT.md            # The script you feed to your AI for first install
│   ├── UPDATE_PROMPT.md             # The script you feed to your AI for upgrading
│   └── templates/                   # Bridge file templates (CLAUDE.md, etc.)
└── README.md
```

### First-Time Installation
1. Download or clone MaiKS anywhere on your machine — it does **not** need to be inside your project. Leave it where it downloaded.
2. Open your project in your AI editor or launch your terminal assistant.
3. Open your AI chat and type: **"Please install the AI OS using the instructions in `<path-to-downloaded-package>/.ai-os-installer/INSTALL_PROMPT.md`"**
4. The agent acts as an installer: it copies just the `.ai-os/` folder into your project as its first step, merges the necessary bridge instructions into your existing rules (e.g., `.windsurfrules`, `CLAUDE.md`) without destroying them, and boots up. `.ai-os-installer/` is never copied in, so there's nothing to clean up afterward.
5. On first boot, the OS notices `manifest.json` is unpopulated and runs the **First-Boot Wizard** — it asks for your project name and runs a perception scan (`INFRA_DETECT_STACK`) to map your tech stack.

Once installed, your workspace looks like this:
```

```

### Upgrading
**WARNING**: Do **not** overwrite your existing `.ai-os/` folder manually — doing so will wipe out your AI's memory.

1. Download the new version of MaiKS and place the unzipped folder in your workspace (e.g., `./maiks-update`).
2. Open your AI chat and type: **"Please update my AI OS using the instructions in `./maiks-update/.ai-os-installer/UPDATE_PROMPT.md`"**
3. The agent acts as a safe updater: it copies the new kernel, rules, and skills, while guarding your `memory/` folder so it isn't overwritten, and merges any new settings into your `manifest.json`.

---

## Efficient Workflow

How to get the most out of MaiKS in your daily development:

1. **The Boot**: While the bridge files naturally instruct the agent to read `.ai-os/BOOT.md` in the background, LLMs don't always act until spoken to. Begin your first chat of the day with: **`> OS_COMMAND BOOT`** to ensure a verified load of your project's memory.
2. **Branch Auto-Detection (Zero Setup)**: Start a new ticket by checking out a branch (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/JIRA-123`). The OS will automatically detect this branch and create a dedicated, isolated task memory file (`tasks/feature_JIRA-123.md`). It will use this file to log deep technical debugging steps so your main project memory isn't polluted — and it'll do the same even if you work directly on `main`/`release` (solo projects, hotfixes, trunk-based workflows). There's no branch where working notes are allowed to skip straight to permanent project memory unverified; on those protected branches the task file is just *rolling* — periodically drained into `project_knowledge.md` by `MEMORY_CONSOLIDATE` instead of closed all at once by `TASK_CLOSE`. Not in a git repo, or in a detached `HEAD` state with no branch to key off? The OS won't skip task memory or invent a name for you — it checks for an already-open task first, and if it can't find one, it just asks what you're working on before creating the file.
3. **Daily Development**: Code normally! You don't need to micromanage the OS. Just ask your agent to build features, fix bugs, or write tests. The OS's security and design rules govern it silently as it works.
4. **Complex Planning**: If you have a big structural change, don't just tell the agent to code. Which command depends on where you're starting from — the two don't overlap. Starting a whole new idea with no project yet? Type `> OS_COMMAND plan`; the `Architect` skill runs a structured interview through project scaffolding. Already inside this project and planning a feature or fix? Type `> OS_COMMAND feature` (`PLAN_BRAINSTORM`) instead; it clarifies scope through a few rounds of questions, writes a concrete step-by-step plan, then executes it with verification at each step.
5. **Task Completion & Consolidation**: When you finish your feature and are ready to open a Pull Request, tell the agent: **`> OS_COMMAND TASK_CLOSE`** (or just say "summarize and close this task"). The AI reads your task memory, checks each candidate fact two ways — is it still factually accurate, and was the underlying change actually accepted rather than still buggy or awaiting your sign-off — before saving anything to the `semantic/` hub, then archives the task file. Nothing gets promoted to permanent memory just because it was written down.

## Backup & Restore (Portability)

MaiKS stores all of its memory, skills, and governance as plain-text Markdown and JSON files within your workspace, so this state travels with your code.

- **To Backup**: Commit the `.ai-os/` directory to your project's Git repository.
- **Merge Conflicts?**:
  - *Append-only Logs (`decisions.jsonl`)*: Git auto-merges append-only logs well.
  - *Semantic Memory (`knowledge/*.md`, indexed by `project_knowledge.md`)*: institutional knowledge is split into topic files to keep concurrent branches from touching the same file. Before deleting something as superseded, it checks Git history first — if another branch added that entry after your branch forked, it flags the conflict instead of silently dropping it on merge. A conflict reaching you is a signal something needs a human look, not intended behavior.
  - *Noisy Files*: The installer adds per-machine files (`sessions.jsonl`, `last_session.json`, and `progress.md`) to your `.gitignore` to reduce merge conflicts — `decisions.jsonl` itself stays tracked, since it's the shared audit trail.
- **To Restore**: When you clone your repo on a new machine (or a teammate clones it), the host AI agent reads the same episodic memories, structural rules, and custom skills. No external database to sync.
